# Framework-for-accesible-musical-expression

Max Cole: 17025115.

Source code for final year project titled "Using interactive machine learning to create an interface independent framework for accessible musical expression"

This repo features 6 seperate entities:
  - LeapHandler.py file: Script to detect hands on the Leap and send position data via OSC
  - ReactivisionHandler.py file: Script to detect fiducial markers and send position data via OSC
  - LeapConfig: Wekinator project template with correct model configuration for Leap
  - ReactivisionCofig: Wekinator project template with correct model configuration for ReacTIVision
  - LeapModel: A pre-trained example model for Leap
  - PuredataFiles: A file contraining all Puredata abstractions and main file. Includes hard coded STM data for Length and Rest Sequencers.
  
These feature only code I have produced and do not include libraries.
This system will be demonstrated in the scheduled viva.
